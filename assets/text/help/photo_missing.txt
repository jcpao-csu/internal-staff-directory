Is your headshot photo missing, or do you simply not have one? The JCPAO will continue to host headshot photo sessions for new employees and current employees wishing to retake or update their headshot photos throughout the year. 
New photo sessions will be communicated via office-wide email. If you have an alternative headshot photo that you prefer to use, please reach out to [Joseph Cho](mailto:ujcho@jacksongov.org) so the directory can reflect your preferred photo.
