In the event that an employee departs from the Office (*e.g., resignation, transition to new job opportunity, school, retirement, etc.*), his or her information will be removed from the directory.
If you are departing, please reach out to [Candace Mims](mailto:candace.mims@jacksongov.org) and [Joseph Cho](mailto:ujcho@jacksongov.org) via email with your scheduled employment end date, so we can update the directory accordingly.
