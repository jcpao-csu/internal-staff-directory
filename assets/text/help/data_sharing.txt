The JCPAO maintains a very strict data sharing policy to protect employees and their personnel data.
Collected user data is only used to maintain the Office's directories.
Please be rest assured that no personnel data is shared publicly. 
The current version of the online directories are only accessible with the security code, which will be changed regularly to maintain security.
Staff will be made aware to changes in the security code via email, so that they will be able to continue to access the directory.
