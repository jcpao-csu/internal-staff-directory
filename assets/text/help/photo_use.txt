To complete their directory profile, employees must also submit a headshot photo to [Joseph Cho](mailto:ujcho@jacksongov.org) to be uploaded to the directory.
Headshot photos, insofar as they are displayed in the directory, will not be disclosed publicly (see *internal staff directory data sharing policy*).
Further, all staff are encouraged to use their office headshot photos for any professional (e.g., LinkedIn, emails) and personal (e.g., other social media) purposes.

To view office headshot photos, please view the One Drive folder [**here**](https://jacksonmo-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ujcho_jacksongov_org/EkQfmaAtb4xIkG8g8EDluEQB6zQdDATdw2CPYcgWcyNirw?e=LYIcnk)
