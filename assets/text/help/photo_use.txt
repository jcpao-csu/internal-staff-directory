To complete their directory profile, employees must also submit a headshot photo to [Joseph Cho](mailto:ujcho@jacksongov.org) to be uploaded to the directory.
Further, all staff are encouraged to use their office headshot photos for any professional (e.g., LinkedIn, emails) and personal (e.g., other social media) purposes.

#### No Headshot Photo?
The JCPAO will continue to host headshot photo sessions for new employees and current employees wishing to retake or update their headshot photos throughout the year. 
New photo sessions will be communicated via office-wide email. If you have an alternative headshot photo that you prefer to use, please reach out to [Joseph Cho](mailto:ujcho@jacksongov.org) so the directory can reflect your preferred photo.
